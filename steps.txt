# Run your FastAPI application and visit http://localhost:8000 (assuming you're running locally) in your browser. You should see the search form.

# Enter a search query in the form and click "Search". The form will submit a POST request to the /search route.

# The search() function will be called, and you can perform your search operation using the query parameter.

# Return the search results as an HTML response. You can format the results as desired, for example, using Jinja2 templates or by constructing the HTML response manually.

# This is a basic example to get you started. You can customize it further based on your specific requirements and integrate the search API accordingly.
